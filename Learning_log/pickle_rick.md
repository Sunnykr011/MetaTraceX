âœ… TryHackMe Room: Pickle Rick
Status: Completed (via walkthrough for clarity)

Time Taken: ~25 minutes

Skills Learned:

Web enumeration using gobuster to find hidden directories (/sup3r_s3cr3t/)

Found login credentials in webpage HTML comments

Accessed internal panel and logged into system

Used Linux commands (ls -a, cat, echo) to extract the flag

Learned basic Linux privilege navigation

Interesting Insight:

Many CTFs hide clues in plain sight: HTML comments, hidden paths, etc.

Brute-forcing directories is a core step in web recon â€” never skip it.

Tools Used: Web browser, Terminal, Gobuster

ðŸ“Œ Reflection
"This room humbled me. I missed the bruteforce step initially, but that failure became my biggest insight. Recon is 80% of hacking â€” donâ€™t assume, enumerate."
